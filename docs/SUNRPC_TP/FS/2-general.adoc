The SunRPC Test Port makes possible to execute test suites towards an IUT. The test port allows sending and receiving Sun RPC messages between the test suite and IUT via a TCP/IP socket connection.

If there are link:1-introduction.md#881135120756544-multiple_connection[multiple connections] established every connection gets an 'id' when it is established. When sending `SunRPC_message_multiple_client` messages, the `client_id` parameter selects the connection on which the message should be sent.

If there is only a single connection established, the `SunRPC_message` can be sent and received by the test suite.

The communication between the SunRPC test port and the TITAN RTE is done by using the API functions described in <<6-references.adoc#_2, [2]>>. The SunRPC test port transfers the Sun RPC protocol messages to the IUT through a network connection.
