= Warning Messages

The following list shows the possible warning messages produced by the test port:

`*SunRPCasp__PT::set_parameter(): Unsupported Test Port parameter: <name>*`

The specified parameter is not recognized by the test port. Check <<2-the_test_port.adoc#SunRPC_Test_Port_Parameters_in_the_RTE_Configuration_File, SunRPC Test Port Parameters in the RTE Configuration File>> for parameter names. The parameter names have to be given case sensitive.

`*<port name>: to switch on SunRPC test port debugging, set the .<port name>.socket_debugging := "yes" in the port's parameters.*`

SunRPC test port produces detailed logs if you specify `thesocket_debugging` := `_"yes"_` in the configuration file.

`*Error when reading the received TCP PDU.*`

There was an error while reading incoming data from the connection. The connection gets disconnected immediately, the test is informed about the disconnect by an `ASP_SunRPC_Close` ASP with the relevant `client_id`.

`*Cannot open socket when trying to open the listen port: <reason>*`

The Listen operation failed because of `<reason>`.

`*Setsockopt failed when trying to open the listen port: <reason>*`

There was an error while allocating a socket because of `<reason>`. The test is informed about the failure by receiving a `ASP_SunRPC_Listen_result` ASP with portnumber = -1.

`*Cannot bind to port when trying to open the listen port: <reason>*`

There was an error while binding to the requested port because of `<reason>`. The test is informed about the failure by receiving a `ASP_SunRPC_Listen_result` ASP with portnumber = -1.

`*Cannot listen at port when trying to open the listen port: <reason>*`

There was an error while trying to listen for incoming connections because of `<reason>`. The test is informed about the failure by receiving a `ASP_SunRPC_Listen_result` ASP with portnumber = -1.

`*getsockname() system call failed on the server socket when trying to open the listen port: <reason>*`

There was an error while trying to listen on the specified port because of `<reason>`. The test is informed about the failure by receiving a `ASP_SunRPC_Listen_result` ASP with portnumber = -1.

`*Cannot open socket when trying to open client connection: <reason>*`

There was an error while allocating a socket for a connection because of <reason>. The test is informed about the failure by receiving a `ASP_SunRPC_Connect_result` ASP with `client_id` = -1.

`*Setsockopt failed when trying to open client connection: <reason>*`

There was an error while allocating a socket for a connection because of <reason>. The test is informed about the failure by receiving a `ASP_SunRPC_Connect_result` ASP with `client_id` = -1.

`*Cannot bind to port when trying to open client connection: <reason>*`

There was an error while binding to the requested port to the socket because of <reason>. The test is informed about the failure by receiving a `ASP_SunRPC_Connect_result` ASP with `client_id` = -1.

`*connect() returned error code EADDRINUSE. Perhaps this is a kernel bug. Trying to connect again.*`

If the connect system call fails because of the 'address is already in use' error, the test port automatically does 16 retry. Meanwhile this warning is logged.

`*Cannot connect to server when trying to open client connection: <reason>*`

The Connect operation failed; look for the reason above this message in the log. A `ASP_SunRPC_Connect_result` with `client_id` = -1 will be returned to the test.

`*Abstract_Socket::remove_client: <client_id> is the server listening port, can not be removed!*`

The specified `client_id` in the `ASP_SunRPC_Close` ASP belongs to the server listening port. Wrong `client_id` is specified.

`*Client <client_id> has not been removed, programming error*`

Please send a bug report including log files produced with all debugging possibilities turned on.

`*Warning: race condition while setting current client object pointer*`

There are multiple instances of the port running trying to access a common resource concurrently. This may cause problem.

`*Connection from client <client_id> is refused*`

The connection from a client is refused in the server.

`*Connection to server is refused*`

The connection from the client is refused by the server.

`*Server did not send a session ID*`

The connection from the client is refused by the server.

`*Verification failed*`

The verification of the other side is failed. The connection will be shut down.

`*SSL object not found for client <client_id>*`

Please send a bug report including log files produced with all debugging possibilities turned on.

`*SSL_Socket::receive_message_on_fd: SSL connection was interrupted by the other side*`

The TLS/SSL connection has been closed. If the protocol version is SSL 3.0 or TLS 1.0, this warning appears only if a closure alert has occurred in the protocol, i.e.Â if the connection has been closed cleanly.

NOTE: In this case it does not necessarily indicate that the underlying transport has been closed.

`*SSL_Socket::send_message_on_fd: SSL connection was interrupted by the other side*`

See above.

`*Other side does not have certificate.*`

The other side of the SSL connection does not have a certificate.

`*Solaris patches to provide random generation devices are not installed. See http://www.openssl.org/support/faq.html ``Why do I get a "PRNG not seeded" error message? A workaround will be used.*`

Solaris patches to provide random generation devices are not installed. A workaround will be used to seed the PRNG.

`*Private key does not match the certificate public key*`

The private key specified for the test port does not match with the public key.
