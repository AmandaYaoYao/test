= Functional Specification

== Protocol Version Implemented

This set of protocol modules implements protocol messages and constants of the BSSMAP protocol, version 11.2.0 (see <<5-references.adoc#_1, [1]>>).

[[modifications-deviations-related-to-the-protocol-specification]]
== Modifications/Deviations Related to the Protocol Specification

=== Implemented Messages

All BSSMAP messages listed in section 3.2 of <<5-references.adoc#_1, [1]>> are implemented, except for the ones listed in <<protocol-modifications-deviations, Protocol Modifications/Deviations>>

[[protocol-modifications-deviations]]
=== Protocol Modifications/Deviations

The following messages are not implemented:

* EMERGENCY RESET INDICATION

* EMERGENCY RESET COMMAND

Message type definitions for these messages are missing from <<5-references.adoc#_1, [1]>>.

[[encoding-decoding-and-other-related-functions]]
== Encoding/Decoding and Other Related Functions

This product also contains encoding/decoding functions that assure correct encoding of messages when sent from TITAN and correct decoding of messages when received by TITAN. Implemented encoding/decoding functions:

[cols=3*,options=header]
|===

|Name |Type of formal parameters |Type of return value
|`enc_PDU_BSSAP` |PDU_BSSAP |octetstring
|`dec_PDU_BSSAP` |octetstring |PDU_BSSAP
|`enc_PDU_BSSAP_fast` |PDU_BSSAP |octetstring
|`dec_PDU_BSSAP_backtrack` |octetstring |PDU_BSSAP
|===

== Limitations

Debug log generation is not supported when this revision of this product is used with TITAN version R7A (1.7pl0), because the encoder/decoder functions, automatically generated by TITAN version R7A (1.7pl0) do not contain logging functions. Newer versions of TITAN supports the debug logging within the automatically generated encoder/decoder functions that can be activated by allowing the `DEBUG_ENCDEC` (see Programmer's Technical Reference for TITAN TTCN-3 Test Executor, clause 6.2.3.2) in TITAN runtime configuration files.
