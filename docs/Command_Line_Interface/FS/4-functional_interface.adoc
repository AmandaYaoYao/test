= Functional Interface

Apart from this description a cross-linked reference guide for the TitanSim CLL Functions can be reached for on-line reading â€Ž<<6-references.adoc#_4, [4]>>.

== Naming Conventions

All functions have the prefix `f_EPTF_CLI_` that belongs to the `EPTF_CLI_CT` component, and `f_EPTF_CLI_Client_` that belongs to the `EPTF_CLI_Client_CT` component.

`f_EPTF_CLI_init_CT`

function should be called. This initializes the EPTF CLI feature.

=== Get Formatted Help of a Command

The function

`f_EPTF_CLI_getHelpTxt`

can be used to get a formatted and detailed help message of a given command. The same message is printed to the terminal when the help is requested for a specific command using the built-in help command: `help <commandName>`

=== Executing a Command

`f_EPTF_CLI_executeCommand`

has to be called.

It executes the given command and returns the result. The command is executed as if it was started on the terminal.

=== Registering New Command to the Terminal

The function

can be used to register a new command to a given terminal. The command name, a short description of it and the handler function has to be specified in its arguments. Optionally the CLI component and the case sensitivity can also be set. By default the CLI given in the init function will be used as CLI, and the command name will be case insensitivity if these parameters are omitted. The case sensitivity refers to the command name only, not to its arguments! On one PTC commands with unique name can be registered only. Spaces are not allowed in command names.
This `registerCommand` function will return the status of the registration (success or failed).

=== Sending Messages to the Display Terminal
