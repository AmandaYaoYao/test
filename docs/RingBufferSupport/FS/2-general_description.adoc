= General Description

TitanSim Ring Buffer component provides a general ring buffer (or circular buffer) implementation. Ring buffer is a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure[data structure] that uses a single, fixed-size http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_%28computer_science%29[buffer] as if it were connected end-to-end. This structure can be easily used for buffering http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_stream[data streams].

TitanSim Ring Buffer is a sequence of elements with maximized size, called capacity. It allows random access to elements and provides constant time insertion and removal at both front-end and back-end of the sequence. If you insert a new element to a full buffer (i.e.Â number of elements is equal with buffer capacity), the element at the other end is being overwritten.

TitanSim Ring Buffer component provides ring buffer implementation both for integer and generic types. Generic (type independent) ring buffer support is implemented through macro-preprocessor of C++ compiler.
