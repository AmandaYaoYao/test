= Functionality

The IMAP 4rev1 protocol module implements the message structures of the related protocol <<5-references.adoc#_4, [4]>> in a formalized way, using the standard specification language TTCN-3. This allows defining of test data (templates) in the TTCN-3 language and correctly encoding/decoding messages when executing test suites using the Titan TTCN-3 test environment.

The IMAP 4rev1 protocol module uses Titanâ€™s TEXT encoding attributes <<5-references.adoc#_3, [3]>> and hence is usable with the Titan test toolset only.

== Implemented Protocols

This set of protocol modules implements protocol messages and constants of the IMAP protocol as described in <<5-references.adoc#_4, [4]>>. All of the IMAP commands, responses and greetings defined in <<5-references.adoc#_4, [4]>> are implemented.

=== Modified and Non-Implemented Protocol Elements

The following rules of <<5-references.adoc#_4, [4]>> are simplified to charstrings: "msg-att", "mbx-list-flags", "list-mailbox".

The rule "flag" of <<5-references.adoc#_4, [4]>> is handled as a restricted charstring.

=== Ericsson-Specific Changes

None.

== Backward Incompatibilities

None.

== System Requirements

Protocol modules are a set of TTCN-3 source code files that can be used as part of TTCN-3 test suites only. Hence, protocol modules alone do not put specific requirements on the system used. However, in order to compile and execute a TTCN-3 test suite using the set of protocol modules the following system requirements must be satisfied:

Titan TTCN-3 Test Executor version CRL 113 200 R7A (1.7.pl0) or higher installed. For Installation Guide see <<5-references.adoc#_2, [2]>>. Please note: This version of the test port is not compatible with Titan releases earlier than CRL 113 200 R7A.
