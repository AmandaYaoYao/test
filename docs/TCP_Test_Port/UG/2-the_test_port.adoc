= The Test Port

== Overview

The TCP test port offers TCP primitives to the test suite in TTCN-3 format. The TTCN-3 definition of the ASPs can be found in a separate TTCN-3 module. This module should be imported into the test suite.

The test port translates the TCP ASP to TCP packets (and vice versa) between the TITAN RTE and the SUT.

See the overview of the test system below:

== Connection ASPs

When using connection ASPs, the following connection controlling ASPs can be sent to the test port:

* `ASP_TCP_Connect`: +
It is used to create a client connection towards a server. `hostname` and `portnumber` are mandatory fields of the ASP containing the remote host name and port number to connect. `local_hostname` and `local_portnumber` are optional fields, the local host interface and port number can be selected by assigning value to them.

* `ASP_TCP_Connect_result`: +
It is returned right after sending a `ASP_TCP_Connect`. The `client_id` field of the received ASP will contain the client id of the assigned connection, which can be used to distinguish among different connections.

* `ASP_TCP_Connected`: +
It is sent by a port which has accepted and incoming client connection. The `hostname`, `portnumber` and `client_id` is filled with the corresponding parameters of the client.

* `ASP_TCP_Close`: +
It is used to close a specific or all connections. If the `client_id` is omitted, all current connections of the port will be closed. If a `client_id` is specified, the connection that belongs to the given `client_id` will be closed. `ASP_TCP_Close` is received if a connection has been closed by the remote side. In this case the `client_id` identifies the connection which has been closed.

* `ASP_TCP_Listen`: +
It is used to open a server listening port. If a listening port was already opened, it will be closed before opening a new one. The client connections will remain alive; they can be closed by sending `ASP_TCP_Close` with omitted `client_id`. If `portnumber` or `local_hostname` is set, the listening port will be bound to the given interface and port number. If the port number is not set, a port will be picked by the kernel to be the listening port.

* `ASP_TCP_Listen_result`: +
It is returned right after sending a `ASP_TCP_Listen`. The port number of the opened listening port is returned in the ASP.

* `ASP_TCP_Shutdown`: +
It can be used to close the listening port. The client connections will remain alive; they can be closed by sending `ASP_TCP_Close` with omitted `client_id`.

`ASP_TCP_Error_report`: +
It is returned right after sending an `ASP_TCP` if error occurred during sending or the whole packet could not be sent. The `ASP_TCP_Error_report` carries the `client_id`, TCP packet data, number of the sent bytes, error type, error code and error descriptions.

* `ASP_TCP_SetAddressFamily`: +
This can be used to change the address family used by the test port during runtime. All subsequent `ASP_TCP_Connect` and `ASP_TCP_Listen` ASPs will use the address family set by this ASP. The `ASP_TCP_SetAddressFamily` can be used several times. All connections keep their actual address family. Only new connections are affected. The allowed values are the following:

** `c_TCP_AF_INET` or `c_TCP_IPv4` to set IPv4
** `c_TCP_AF_INET6` or `c_TCP_IPv6` to set IPv6
** `c_TCP_AF_UNSPEC` or `c_TCP_UNSPEC` to set UNSPEC

For more information about connection ASPs, see the 'Start Procedure' section of <<7-references.adoc#_4, [4]>>.

== Installation

Since the TCP test port is used as a part of the TTCN-3 test environment this requires TTCN-3 Test Executor to be installed before any operation of the TCP test port. For more details on the installation of TTCN-3 Test Executor see the relevant section of <<7-references.adoc#_2, [2]>>.

The compilation of SSL related code parts can be disabled by not defining the `AS_USE_SSL` macro in the _Makefile_ during the compilation.

When building the executable test suite the libraries compiled for the OpenSSL toolkit (if the `AS_USE_SSL` macro is defined) and the TTCN-3 Test Executor should also be linked into the executable. For more information see also <<7-references.adoc#_2, [2]>>. OpenSSL libraries should be added to the _Makefile_ (to `LDFLAGS` variable) generated by the TITAN executor.

[source]
LDFLAGS = -lssl

NOTE: If you are using the test port on Solaris, you have to set the `PLATFORM` macro to the proper value. It is `_SOLARIS_` in case of Solaris 6 (SunOS 5.6) and `_SOLARIS8_` in case of Solaris 8 (SunOS 5.8).

== Configuration

The executable test program behavior is determined via the RTE configuration file. This is a simple text file, which contains various sections (e.g. `[TESTPORT_PARAMETERS]`) after each other. The usual suffix of the RTE configuration file is _.cfg_. For further information about the configuration file see <<7-references.adoc#_2, [2]>>.

See the overview of the configuration process below:

image:images/Overview_config_process.png[alt]

=== TCP Test Port Parameters in the RTE Configuration File

In the `[TESTPORT_PARAMETERS]` section you can specify parameters that are passed to the test ports. Each parameter definition consists of a component name, a port name, a parameter name and a parameter value. The component name can be either an identifier or a component reference (integer) value. The port and parameter names are identifiers while the parameter value always must be a charstring (with quotation marks). Instead of component name or port name (or both of them) the asterisk ("*") sign can be used, which means "all components" or "all ports of the component". More information about the RTE configuration file can be found in <<7-references.adoc#_2, [2]>>.

In the `[TESTPORT_PARAMETERS]` section the following parameters can be set for the TCP test port. If the corresponding parameter is mandatory an (M), if it is optional an (O) is shown after its name:

[[tcp-test-port-parameters-in-the-test-port-configuration-file-if-the-transport-channel-is-tcp-ip]]
==== TCP Test Port Parameters in the Test Port Configuration File if the Transport Channel is TCP/IP

 `use_connection_ASPs` (O)

The parameter is optional, and can be used to specify whether the test port wants to send and receive connection ASPs. If set to `_"yes"_`, the `server_mode` and address/port parameters have no meaning, since they have to be specified in the connection ASPs sent.

`server_mode` (O)

The parameter is optional, and can be used to specify whether the test port shall act as a server or a client. If the value is `_"yes"_`, the test port will act as a server. If the value is `_"no"_`, the test port will act as a client.

The default value is `_"no"_`.

`socket_debugging` (O)

The parameter is optional, and can be used to enable debug logging related to the transport channel (TCP socket and SSL operations) in the test port.

The default value is `_"no"_`.

`halt_on_connection_reset` (O)

The parameter is optional, and can be used to specify whether the test port shall stop on errors occurred during connection setup (including connection refusing), sending and receiving, disconnection (including the detection of the disconnection). The value `_"yes"_` means the test port will stop, the value `_"no"_` means that it will not stop on such errors.

The default value is `_"no"_` in server mode and `_"yes"_` in client mode.

`nagling` (O)

The parameter is optional, and can be used to specify whether concatenation occurs on TCP layer. If value is `_"yes"_`, concatenation is enabled. If value is `_"no"_`, it is disabled. The nagling setting is valid only for the outgoing messages, the nagling for the incoming messages is set by the sending party.

The default value is `_"no"_`.`__`

`destIPAddr` (client mode – M, server mode – not used)

The parameter can be used to specify the server's IP address. It is mandatory in client mode and not used in server mode.

`destPort` (client mode – M, server mode – not used)

The parameter can be used to specify the server's listening port. It is mandatory in client mode and not used in server mode.

`serverIPAddr` (O)

The parameter can be used to specify the server's local IP address. Its presence is optional both in server and client mode.

The default value is `_"localhost"_`.

`serverPort` (client mode – O, server mode – M)

The parameter can be used to specify the port where the server is listening for connections. It is mandatory in server mode and optional in client mode.

`addressFamily` (O)

The parameter can be used to specify the address family to use when opening listening ports or creating client connections. If its value is set to `_"IPv4"_`, or `_"AF_INET"_`, only IPv4 addresses are used. If it is set to `_"IPv6"_` or `_"AF_INET6"_` only IPv6 connections are allowed. The values `_"UNSPEC"_` and `_"AF_UNSPEC"_` can be used if the address family is not specified. This allows using IPv4 and IPv6 addresses at the same time. The selection is made automatically depending on the actual value of the local and remote addresses. This parameter is optional.

The default value is `_"AF_UNSPEC"_`.

`server_backlog` (client mode – not used, server mode – O)

The parameter can be used to specify the number of allowed pending (queued) connection requests on the port the server listens. It is optional in server mode and not used in client mode.

The default value is `_"1"_`.

`packet_hdr_length_offset` (O)

If there is a protocol above TCP this parameter can be used to specify the offset (in bytes) in the protocol header where the `length` field starts. This parameter is optional, but should be used together with `packet_hdr_nr_bytes_in_length`, `packet_hdr_byte_order`, `packet_hdr_length_value_offset` and `packet_hdr_length_multiplier`. These parameters are used to wait for a complete upper layer protocol message by the test port.

`packet_hdr_nr_bytes_in_length` (O)

If there is a protocol above TCP this parameter can be used to specify the length of the `length` field (in bytes) in the protocol header. This parameter is optional, but must be used together with `packet_hdr_length_offset`, `packet_hdr_byte_order`, `packet_hdr_length_value_offset` and `packet_hdr_length_multiplier`. These parameters are used to wait for a complete upper layer protocol message by the test port.

`packet_hdr_byte_order` (O)

If there is a protocol above TCP this parameter can be used to specify the byte order of the protocol. The possible values are: `_"MSB"_` or `_"LSB"_`.

`_"MSB"_` is the default value.

This parameter is optional, but should be used together with `packet_hdr_length_offset`, `packet_hdr_nr_bytes_in_length`, `packet_hdr_length_value_offset` and `packet_hdr_length_multiplier`. These parameters are used to wait for a complete upper layer protocol message by the test port.

packet_hdr_length_value_offset* (O)

If there is a protocol above TCP this parameter can be used to specify the offset (in bytes) of the value length which is added for the length decoded from the message. This parameter is optional, but should be used together with `packet_hdr_length_offset`, `packet_hdr_nr_bytes_in_length`, `packet_hdr_byte_order` and `packet_hdr_length_multiplier`. These parameters are used to wait for a complete upper layer protocol message by the test port.

`packet_hdr_length_multiplier` (O)

If there is a protocol above TCP this parameter can be used to specify the multiplier of the `decoded_length_`

`_"1"_` is the default value.

This parameter is optional, but should be used together with `packet_hdr_length_offset`, `packet_hdr_nr_bytes_in_length`, `packet_hdr_byte_order` and `packet_hdr_length_value_offset`. These parameters are used to wait for a complete upper layer protocol message by the test port.

*Example*

Let’s see how we could calculate the real message length using the previously introduced parameters:

[source]
----
real_length = packet_hdr_length_multiplier x decoded_length + packet_hdr_length_value_offset,
----
where `decoded_length` is calculated from the length field in the message and `real_length` is the real message length.

If we set the parameters as follows:

[source]
----
packet_hdr_length_offset := ``2'';
packet_hdr_nr_bytes_in_length := ``2'';
packet_hdr_byte_order := ``MSB'';
packet_hdr_length_value_offset := ``2'';
packet_hdr_length_multiplier := ``3'';
----

and the following message arrives from the upper layer protocol:

[source]
message = ‘AAAA**0002**BBBBBBBBCCCC**0002**DDDDDDDD’O

the `decoded_length` = `_"2"_` (bold in the message) because the value starts from the 3rd octet while header length offset is 2 octets, the number of bytes in the header is 2 octets and the byte order is MSB. The multiplier is 3 and the value offset is 2 so `real_length` = `_"2 x 3 + 2 = 8"_`. (We are using the parameters in the example configuration file in Section 5.1, TCP_server3).

We can see that two messages arrived together and the test port will split them into the following messages:

[source]
----
*message1 = ‘AAAA0002BBBBBBBB’O*
*message2 = ‘CCCC0002DDDDDDDD’O*
----

==== Additional TCP Test Port Parameters in the Test Port Configuration File if the Transport Channel is SSL

Apart from the previously mentioned parameters, the following test port parameters can be used in case SSL is used:

`ssl_use_ssl` (O)

The parameter is optional, and can be used to specify whether to use SSL on the top of the TCP connection or not.

The default value is `_"no"_`.

`ssl_verify_certificate` (O)

The parameter is optional, and can be used to tell the test port whether to check the certificate of the other side. If it is defined `_"yes"_`, the test port runs a query and checks the certificate. If the certificate is not valid (i.e. the public and private keys do not match), it will exit with a corresponding error message. If it is defined `_"no"_`, the test port will not check the validity of the certificate.

The default value is `_"no"_`.

`ssl_use_session_resumption` (O)

The parameter is optional, and can be used to specify whether to use/support SSL session resumptions or not.

The default value is `_"yes"_`.

`ssl_certificate_chain_file` (client mode – O, server mode – M)

It specifies a 'pem' encoded file’s path on the file system containing the certificate chain. For detailed information see <<7-references.adoc#_6, [6]>>. It is mandatory in server mode and optional in client mode. Note that the server may require client authentication. In this case no connection can be established without a client certificate.

`ssl_private_key_file` (client mode – O, server mode – M)

It specifies a 'pem' encoded file’s path on the file system containing the server’s RSA private key. For detailed information see <<7-references.adoc#_6, [6]>>. It is mandatory in server mode and optional in client mode.

`ssl_private_key_password` (O)

The parameter is optional and can be used to specify the password protecting the private key file. If not defined, the SSL toolkit will ask for it.

`ssl_trustedCAlist_file` (M)

It specifies a 'pem' encoded file’s path on the file system containing the certificates of the trusted CA authorities to use. It is mandatory in server mode and mandatory in client mode if `ssl_verify_certificate` is set to `_"yes"_`.

`ssl_allowed_ciphers_list` (O)

The parameter is optional, and can be used to specify the allowed cipher list. The value is passed directly to the SSL toolkit.

In the RTE configuration file it is possible to define the name and path of the RTE log file. Debug output from the test port is written into the RTE log file. If no path is given in the configuration file, the RTE log file is stored in the working directory.

== Start Procedure

=== TTCN-3 Test Executor

Before running the executable test suite the TTCN-3 modules and C++ codes should be compiled and linked into an executable program. This process can be automated using the make utility. The _Makefile_ generation process is described in <<7-references.adoc#_2, [2]>>.

NOTE: The C++ implementation files __TCPasp_PT.hh__ and __TCPasp_PT.cc__ of the test port, and implementation files of the Abstract_Socket (CNL 113 384) component common __Abstract_Socket.cc__ and __Abstract_Socket.hh__, must be included in the _Makefile_.

If the executable test suite is ready, run it giving the RTE configuration file as argument in your terminal:

[source]
Home> ExecutabletestSuite RTEConfigurationFile.cfg

For more information, see <<7-references.adoc#_2, [2]>>.

== Using the Test Port in TTCN3

[[handling-single-multiple-clients]]
=== Handling Single/Multiple Clients

The ASP of the port has an optional member called `client_id`. This id identifies the client, when connection ASPs are used, or the port is used in server mode, with multiple clients. When the port is used in client mode, or in server mode with one single client, for simplicity reasons the `client_id` can be omitted. In case of sending the `_"omit"_` value, in case of "receiving" the "*" wildcard is applied.

Example templates for single client mode:

[source]
----
template ASP_TCP send_packet(PDU_TCP tcp_packet_data) := \{ client_id := omit, data := tcp_packet_data
}
template ASP_TCP receive_packet(PDU_TCP tcp_packet_data) := \{ client_id := *, data := tcp_packet___data
}
----

== Stop Procedure

[[ttcn-3-test-executor-0]]
=== TTCN-3 Test Executor

The test port should stop automatically after it finished the execution of all test cases. It closes down the TCP socket towards the SUT and terminates.

The execution of the test suite can be stopped at any time by pressing `<Cntr>-c`. It shuts down the socket and terminates.
