= Function Specification for Testing with SEA in STC Mode

== Connection Establishment

By map operation an MPH connection is established towards the SEA entity determined via the Test Port Parameters. See <<8_references.adoc#_5, [5]>>, <<8_references.adoc#_6, [6]>>, <<8_references.adoc#_7, [7]>>, <<8_references.adoc#_8, [8]>>.

== Data Transfer

The same ASPs are used as in other modes, but only the 'data' field is used. Every other field is filled with `_0_`.

When `ASP_MTP3_TRANSFERreq` is received from TTCN, then the 'data' field is forwarded to the SEA without any modification.

At reception of any message from SEA the message is put into the 'data' field of `ASP_MTP3_TRANSFERind` and every other field is filled with `_0_`.

== Disconnection

At `unmap` operation the MPH connection towards SEA is closed.
