= Protocol Modules

== Overview

Protocol modules implement the message structure of the related protocol in a formalized way, using the standard specification language TTCN-3. This allows defining of test data (templates) in the TTCN-3 language <<6-references.adoc#_3, [3]>> and correctly encoding/decoding messages when executing test suites using the Titan TTCN-3 test environment.

== Installation

The set of protocol modules can be used for developing TTCN-3 test suites using any text editor. However to make the work more efficient a TTCN-3- enabled text editor is recommended (e.g.Â `nedit`, `xemacs`). Since the GRE protocol is used as a part of a TTCN-3 test suite, this requires Titan TTCN-3 Test Executor be installed before the module can be compiled and executed together with other parts of the test suite. For more details on the installation of TTCN-3 Test Executor see the relevant section of <<6-references.adoc#_4, [4]>>.

== Configuration

== Module parameters

No module parameters are used in the ICAP protocol module.
