= General Description

This document specifies the Time Profile Editor feature of the TitanSim CLL.

The EPTF Time Profile Editor feature makes it possible to

* Create and edit _time sequences_
* Create and edit _time profiles_ using the time sequences
* Load and save _time sequences_ and _time profiles_
* Display a preview chart of the edited _time profile_
* Display a preview of the configuration file corresponding to the _time sequences_ and _time profiles_ edited in the Time Profile Editor.

The aim of the EPTF Time Profile Editor feature is to allow the TitanSim user to edit time profiles for the test execution.

To be able to use EPTF Time Profile Editor, the user has to compile its sources and run the control part. When a Runtime GUI connects to the running TPE, the TPE will initialize a layout on it to make possible the creation of the time profiles.
