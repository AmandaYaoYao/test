= General

The UD Test Port makes it possible to execute test suites towards a SUT. The test port offers UD primitives to the test suite and communicates with the SUT.

The communication between the UD test port and the TITAN RTE is done by using the API functions described in <<5-references.adoc#_2, [2]>>. The UD protocol messages are then transferred by the UD test port to the SUT.
