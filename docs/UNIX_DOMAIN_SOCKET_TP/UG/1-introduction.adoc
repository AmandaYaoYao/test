== About This Document

=== How to Read This Document

This is the Userâ€™s Guide for the UD test port. The UD test port is developed for the TTCN-3 Toolset with TITAN. This document is intended to be read together with Function Specification <<6-references.adoc#_3, [3]>>.

=== Prerequisite Knowledge

The knowledge of the TITAN TTCN-3 Test Executor <<6-references.adoc#_2, [2]>> and the TTCN-3 language <<6-references.adoc#_1, [1]>> is essential. Basic knowledge of the UD protocol is valuable when reading this document.

== System Requirements

In order to operate the UD test port the following system requirements must be satisfied:

* Platform: Solaris 5.8
* TITAN TTCN-3 Test Executor version R7A (1.7.pl0) or higher installed. For installation guide see <<6-references.adoc#_2, [2]>>.

NOTE: This version of the test port is not compatible with TITAN releases earlier than R7A.

* The same C compiler gcc version installed which the TITAN was compiled with. See the Release Notes of TITAN.

For other known limitations please see the FS <<6-references.adoc#_3, [3]>>.

== Fundamental Concepts

The test port establishes UD connection between the TTCN-3 test executor and the SUT. The test port transmits and receives UD protocol messages between the TITAN RTE and the SUT.
