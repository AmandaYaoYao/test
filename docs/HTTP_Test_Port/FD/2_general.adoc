The HTTP Test Port makes possible to execute test suites towards an IUT. The test port allows sending and receiving HTTP messages between the test suite and IUT via a TCP/IP socket connection.

The HTTP Test Port can be used as a protocol module via encoding and decoding functions, see <<3_function_specification.adoc#encoding_and_decoding_functions, Encoding and Decoding Functions>>.

Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.

The test port can handle multiple connections. Every connection gets an 'id' when it is established. When sending HTTP messages, the `client_id` parameter selects the connection on which the message should be sent. If it is set to `omit`, the HTTP message will be sent on the first available connection.

The communication between the HTTP test port and the TITAN RTE is done by using the API functions described in <<5_references.adoc#_2, [2]>>


The HTTP protocol messages are then transferred by the HTTP test port to the IUT through a network connection.
