= Assertion Functions

== Overview

Assertion functions enable you to apply assertion from TTCN-3.

These Assertion Functions were tested under Linux/Solaris/Cygwin platforms.

Assertion Functions are implemented in the following files:

* __TCCAssertion_Functions.ttcn__
* _TCCAssertion.cc_

== Function Definitions

The following Assertion Functions are defined. For the exact API check the generated NaturalDocs documentation.

`external function f_assert(const CHARSTRING& pl_assertMessage, boolean pl_predicate);`

If assertion is activated, `f_assert` assures that the `pl_predicate` parameter is true at call of the function. Else it fails with dynamic test case error and displays assertion message (`pl_assertMessage`) as well. To use assertion, optimized build has to be turned on with the â€“O2 switch and NDEBUG shall not be defined. By defining `NDEBUG`, the main block of `f_assert` will be empty, therefore in case of enabled optimized build (-O2) the function is not compiled with the generated code. This results higher debug capability with higher performance.
