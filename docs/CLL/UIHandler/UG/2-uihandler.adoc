= UIHandler

== Overview

Users of TitanSim may want to interactively display their data on a user interface or they want to control the behaviour of their tests through such interface. The UIHandler feature provides support for this.

The `EPTF_CLL_UIHandlerClient_CT` component may have EPTF Variables and it can connect these variables to widgets on a runtime GUI connected to an UIHandler. When the variable changes, the content of the connected widget will be changed automatically. When the user changes the content of a connected widget, its new value will be automatically forwarded to the associated variable.

The `EPTF_CLL_UIHandler_VariableUI_CT` can be used just like `EPTF_CLL_UIHandlerClient_CT`, but it provides some functions that can be used to handle masses of variable â€“ widget subscriptions.

It also provides functions to change the layout of the GUI.

Usage in steps:

* Create an UIHandler component, and map the necessary ports.
* Initialize the UIHandler component.
* Create your component that extends `EPTF_CLL_UIProviderClient_CT` and implicitly the `EPTF_Var_CT`. Initialize the UIHandlerClient component.
* Create and/or modify the runtime GUI configuration where you want to display your data.
* Create your variables.
* Order the UIHandler via functions of the UIHandlerClient to subscribe to your variables, and connect these variables to widgets. If you want to connect your variables to more than one widget, you can do it.
* Run your test logic.

The feature can operate in either as a client and a server too, to make connection with the Runtime GUI. The UIhandler, if used with headless mode activated, is capable of seamlessly continue operation even if the connection to the runtime GUI is lost. Alternately you can use a web browser to view the GUI. For more details see <<8-references.adoc#_3, [3]>>.

== Usage Dependencies

The UIHandler feature is part of the EPTF Core Library (CLL). It relies on several features of the CLL. To use the UIHandler the user has to obtain the respective files from the following features:

* Base
* Common
* FreeBusyQueue
* HashMap
* Logging
* Semaphore
* Transport
* Variable

UIHandler also requires files from TestPorts, ProtocolModules

* XTDPasp_CNL113494
* Common_Components/Abstract_Socket_CNL113384
* Common_Components/Socket_API_CNL113686
* XTDP_CNL113663
* XSDASN_CNL113474
* TELNETasp_CNL113320
