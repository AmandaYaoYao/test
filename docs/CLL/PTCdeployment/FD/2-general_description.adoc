= General Description

The EPTF PTCDeployment implements the functionality that allows components to choose a host where new PTCs can be deployed according to specified tasks called roles in the PTCD component.

The PTCD component has the following functionalities:

* Add hosts, roles to the database
* Remove hosts from the database
* Query a host from the database according to a role

The query happens in a probabilistic way. Every host in the database has a positive integer index called weight that specifies a probability of choosing that host.

There are two ways implemented of choosing the host also. The default is using the TTCN `rnd()` random generator function, and there is a deterministic algorithm too.

Example:

The database contains the following hosts  for a role:

* Host A with weight 1
* Host B with weigth 9

That means, that there is a 10% chance of choosing "Host A" and 90% of choosing "Host B".
