= General Description

This document specifies the HashMap feature of the TitanSim CLL. The feature provides access to a well-tested, industry standard GCC HashMap implementation located in STL. For gcc versions above 4.0 the HashMap feature uses the `std::tr1::unordered_map` library. HashMap is a hashed associate container that associates object of type key with object of type data. It works by transforming the key using a hash function into a hash, a number that is used as an index in an array, to locate the desired location ("bucket") where the values should be. Looking up an element in a HashMap by its key is efficient, so HashMap is useful for "dictionaries" where the order of elements is irrelevant. The key in HashMap must be unique.

This component supports the following key â€“> data type associations:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|====================
|Key type |Data type
|Integer |Integer
|Charstring |Integer
|Octetstring |Integer
|====================

To be able to use EPTF HashMap feature, the user component should extend the `EPTF_HashMap_CT` component and before using other HashMap functions, should call its initializing function `f_EPTF_HashMap_init_CT`.
