== About This Document

=== How to Read This Document

This is the User Guide for the HTTP application library. HTTP application library is developed for the TTCN-3 Toolset with TITAN. This document should be read together with Function Specification <<6-references.adoc#_5, [5]>>.

=== Presumed Knowledge

To use this protocol module the knowledge of the TTCN-3 language <<6-references.adoc#_4, [4]>> is essential.

== System Requirements

Application library modules are a set of TTCN-3 source code files that can be used as part of TTCN-3 test suites only. Hence, the modules alone do not put specific requirements on the system used. However in order to compile and execute a TTCN-3 test suite using the set of implemented modules the following system requirements must be satisfied:

* TITAN TTCN-3 Test Executor with version 1.8.pl0 or later is installed. For installation guide see <<6-references.adoc#_6, [6]>>.
