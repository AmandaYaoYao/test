= Limitations

The test port does not support server mode.

The test port does not handle the messages about the fingerprint of the remote host. Before the test execution the remote host should be properly authenticated, and there should be a corresponding record in the __~/.ssh/known_hosts__ file (e.g.Â invoking ssh manually).

As this port is not a native implementation the limitations of the underlying OpenSSH client utility is also included.
