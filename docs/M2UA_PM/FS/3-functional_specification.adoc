= Functional Specification

== Protocol Version Implemented

This set of protocol modules implements protocol messages and constants of M2UA protocol (see <<5-references.adoc#_1, [1]>>).

[[modifications-deviations-related-to-the-protocol-specification]]
== Modifications/deviations Related to the Protocol Specification

=== Implemented Messages

All M2UA message types of message classes 0, 3, 4, 6 and 10 as listed in chapter 3.1.4 of <<5-references.adoc#_1, [1]>> will be implemented.

All M2UA parameters as listed in chapter 3.1.6 of <<5-references.adoc#_1, [1]>> will be implemented.

[[protocol-modifications-deviations]]
=== Protocol Modifications/Deviations

Although the interface identifier parameters 0x0001, 0x0008 (integer) and 0x0003 (text) are mutually exclusive (see e.g.Â chapter 3.3.2.7 in <<5-references.adoc#_1, [1]>>), this restriction has not been implemented.

[[encoding-decoding-and-other-related-functions]]
== Encoding/Decoding and Other Related Functions

This product also contains encoding/decoding functions that assure correct encoding of messages when sent from Titan and correct decoding of messages when received by Titan. Implemented encoding/decoding functions:

[cols=3*,options=header]
|===

|Name
|Type of formal parameters
|Type of return value

|`enc_PDU_M2UA`
|PDU_M2UA
|octetstring

|`dec_PDU_M2UA`
|octetstring
|PDU_M2UA
|===

== Limitations

Debug log generation is not supported when this revision of this product is used with TITAN version R7A (1.7pl0), because the encoder/decoder functions, automatically generated by TITAN version R7A (1.7pl0) does not contain logging functions. Newer versions of TITAN supports the debug logging within the automatically generated encoder/decoder functions that can be activated by allowing the `DEBUG_ENCDEC` (see <<5-references.adoc#_3, [3]>>, clause 7.2.3.2) in TITAN runtime configuration files.
