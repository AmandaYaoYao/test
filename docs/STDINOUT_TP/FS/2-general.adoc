The STDINOUT Test Port provides a simple interface between the TTCN-3 test suite and operator.

The operator can enter text in a terminal (stdin) and the test port transmits this text as a charstring to the TTCN-3 test suite.

The TTCN-3 test suite can send a charstring and the test port outputs this to the terminal (stdout).
