= Protocol Modules

== Overview

Protocol modules implement the messages structure of the related protocol in a formalized way, using the standard specification language TTCN-3. This allows defining of test data (templates) in the TTCN-3 language <<5-references.adoc#_1, [1]>> and correctly encoding/decoding messages when executing test suites using the Titan TTCN-3 test environment.

Protocol module is using Titanâ€™s TEXT encoding attributes <<5-references.adoc#_2, [2]>> and hence is usable with the Titan test toolset only.

== Installation

The set of protocol modules can be used in developing TTCN-3 test suites using any text editor. However to make the work more efficient a TTCN-3-enabled text editor is recommended, for example `nedit`, `xemacs`. Since the SMTP protocol is used as a part of a TTCN-3 test suite, this requires TTCN-3 Test Executor be installed before the module can be compiled and executed together with other parts of the test suite. For more details on the installation of TTCN-3 Test Executor see the relevant section of <<5-references.adoc#_2, [2]>>.

== Configuration

None.
