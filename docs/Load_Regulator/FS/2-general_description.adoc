= General Description

This document specifies the Load Regulator feature of the TitanSim CLL.

The EPTF Load Regulator feature makes it possible to regulate the CPS of a load generator based on the load of the SUT.

To be able to use EPTF Load Regulator, the user component should extend the `EPTF_LoadRegulator_CT` component.
