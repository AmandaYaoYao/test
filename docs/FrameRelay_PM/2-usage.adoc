= Usage

== Installation

The set of protocol modules can be used in developing TTCN-3 test suites using any text editor; however, to make the work more efficient a TTCN3enabled text editor is recommended (for example `nedit`, `xemacs`). Since the Frame Relay protocol is used as a part of a TTCN-3 test suite, this requires TTCN-3 Test Executor be installed before the module can be compiled and executed together with other parts of the test suite. For more details on the installation of TTCN-3 Test Executor see the relevant section of <<5-references.adoc#_2, [2]>>.
