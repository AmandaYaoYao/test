*TitanSim Core (Load) Library(CLL):* +
It is that part of the TitanSim software that is totally project independent. (I.e., which is not protocol-, or application-dependent). The TitanSim CLL is to be supplied and supported by the TCC organization. Any TitanSim CLL development is to be funded centrally by Ericsson.

*TitanSim Appliaction Library:* +
It is the application-specific part of the TitanSim software. It provides load generation functionalities belonging to specific protocols or products.

== System Requirements

Application libraries are a set of TTCN-3 source code files that can be used as part of TTCN-3 test suites only. Hence, application libraries alone do not put specific requirements on the system used. However in order to compile and execute a TTCN-3 test suite using the set of application libraries the following system requirements must be satisfied:

* TITAN TTCN-3 Test Executor <<6-references.adoc#_2, â€Ž[2]>> version 1.7.pl2 installed.
