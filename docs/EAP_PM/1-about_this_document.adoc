= About This Document

== Presumed Knowledge

To use this protocol module the knowledge of the TTCN-3 language <<7-references.adoc#_1, [1]>> is essential.

== System Requirements

Protocol modules are a set of TTCN-3 source code files that can be used as part of TTCN-3 test suites only. Hence, protocol modules alone do not put specific requirements on the system used. However, in order to compile and execute a TTCN-3 test suite using the set of protocol modules the following system requirements must be satisfied:

Titan TTCN-3 Test Executor version CRL 113 200 R7A (1.7.pl0) or higher installed. For Installation Guide see <<7-references.adoc#_2, [2]>>.

NOTE: This version of the test port is not compatible with Titan releases earlier than CRL 113 200 R7A.
