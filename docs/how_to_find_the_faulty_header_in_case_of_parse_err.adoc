= How to find the faulty header in case of parse error

The following error or warning message indicates a faulty SIP message:

*-> unexpected character at character position:*

The behaviour of the test port in case of the faulty SIP message is controlled by the ``error_mode'' test port parameter:

``ignore'' The test port ignore any erroneous messages and discard them without notice.

``Warning'' The test port will issue a warning if erroneous message received and pass the message as RAW message to the test case.

``error'' The test port will generate error if erroneous message received.

The default value is “_error”._

In order to avoid the TTCN error during the test campaign it is recommended to set it to ``warning''. The default value are kept for backward compatibility reason.

The decoder function, f_SIP_decode, returns the erroneous message as RAW message.

== Identify the error

The error message contains the faulty character and its position within the faulty SIP message. In order to find the fault the message should be logged.

The faulty message is logged if the ``debug'' is enabled or the test case should log the received RAW message.

The place of the fault is indicated in the error message, so SIP parser found the fault at the nth character.

== Example

Warning: SIP Test Port: syntax error ``='' -> unexpected character at character position 170.

The faulty character, which is the 170th character of the message, is indicated by red mark.

Please note that the and the represents only 1 character.
